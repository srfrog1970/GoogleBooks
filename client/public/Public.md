# Public Folder

    Welcome to the Public folder. This document is going to describe all the folders/files in the Public directory. This is one of many different architectures you can use when building any application.

    The public folder is where you store your assets (icons, jpg, ico etc.) and your index HTML. The index.html file is the start of your react application!

## index.html File

    This is your main page. All react components are rendered in here at the `<div id="root">`

## manifest.json File

    Web app manifests are part of a collection of web technologies called progressive web apps (PWAs), which are websites that can be installed to a deviceâ€™s homescreen without an app store. Unlike regular web apps with simple homescreen links or bookmarks, PWAs can be downloaded in advance and can work offline, as well as use regular Web APIs.
